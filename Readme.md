# What is SchematicSaver

SchematicSaver is your tool to decompose and export your Structures.
Build your Stuff like you wanna have it in the end and then disassemble it based on templates.
Your schematics will be exported with sorted names and easy to manage.
You can use them with SchematicBrushReborn or for anything else.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/SchematicSaver/wiki) for more
